Analytics was started by [Edward Kmett](https://github.com/ekmett) in response to a question by [Alec Heller](https://github.com/deviant-logic) about if he should use `bound` to implement datalog. It has since somewhat expanded in scope.

`bits` was spun out of work that was being done on the `analytics` repository in bitwise encodings for compression schemes.

You can watch contributors carry on the quest for bragging rights in the [contributors graph](https://github.com/analytics/bits/graphs/contributors).

Omission from this list is by no means an attempt to discount your contribution.

Thank you for all of your help!
